  Impact of Technology: Robot Caregivers for Seniors
  </h1>
  <p>
    Robot Companions and Caregivers for Seniors meet the needs of
    the elderly by introducing robot companions and carers for seniors by
    offering company, useful help, and personalization. They encourage a
    more inclusive society and lighten the workload for medical
    professionals.
    <br><br>
    We have chosen the topic of Robot companions and caregivers for 
    seniors due to the fact that the elderly often face loneliness 
    in care home, this is supported by stats that one in three seniors 
    are lonely according to time magazine and they aren’t supported with
    caring empathetic staff - "...1 in 3 people aged 80 will have 
    difficulties undertaking five or more tasks of daily living 
    unaided..."(Costa, 2018), which has historically led to find 
    staff and robots can make up for this lack of manpower because 
    Seniors have a lot to gain from robot companions and carers, 
    including aid with everyday tasks, companionship, 
    and even health monitoring. They can give seniors' 
    families and carers peace of mind while also assisting 
    seniors in maintaining their independence and quality of 
    life. Additionally, using robots to provide care may result 
    in lower healthcare costs and a solution to the rising need 
    for eldercare as the population ages.​
    <br><br>
    Care of the elderly shows challenges to
    many civilizations. Globally, the population of seniors is multiplying. According to projections, the number of persons in the globe
    who are 60 or older would increase from 901 million in 2015 to 1.4 billion in 2030 and 2.1 billion in 2050. According to
    projections, there would be 434 million "oldest old," or people 80 and older, by the year 2050, up from 125 million in 2015,
    according to (Baecker, 2019). However, finding adequate care for senior citizens is challenging due to the demographic trend of
    dropping birth rates, which also lowers the carer support ratio. For instance, it is predicted that in the USA, the ratio of potential
    family carers aged 45 to 64 to the total number of elderly people in the nation will drop to only seven in 2010 and, in 2050, will be
    less than three. There will be fewer and fewer people to care for the increasing number of elderly due to the difficulties in hiring
    and training hired caregivers. For example, this study investigates using robots, particularly the PARO robot, to support older
    individuals' social and emotional needs as a potential advantage. Robots like PARO can offer companionship and support as the
    older population rises and social isolation becomes a worry. Previous research has demonstrated the benefits of older persons
    interacting with PARO, such as enhanced happiness and social network growth. However, there is a need to comprehend how
    attitudes, engagement, and emotions are connected to interactions between humans and robots using PARO, according to (Nur, 2016), 
    particularly for older individuals who live independently. The study looks into the attitudes, levels of
    engagement, and emotional reactions of older individuals to PARO. According to the hypothesis, older persons will view PARO
    favourably, participate actively, and feel good when interacting with it.
